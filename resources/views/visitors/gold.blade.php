<p class="text-muted mt-4">
          One of the attractions of gold and silver is that both can be purchased in a variety of investment forms:
        </p>
<p class="mt-4">
<b>Physical Metals:</b> Unlike stocks and bonds, gold and silver can be purchased as physical assets, as either bars and coins held as part of a Sterling brokerage account or as American Eagle coins held in a retirement account. The metals would be held by a third-party depository, not Sterling, though investors can take physical delivery if they want to store it themselves.
        </p>
<p class="mt-4">
<b>Exchange-Traded Funds:</b>
          ETFs have become a popular way for investors to gain exposure to gold and silver, without having the responsibility of storing a physical asset. You can buy shares and keep them in a traditional brokerage account. The fund’s operator is responsible for handling the costs of holding a physical supply of gold or silver and charging an expense ratio. But investing in an ETF doesn’t give investors access to the underlying metals. Also, some precious-metal ETFs are taxed as collectibles and don’t benefit from lower longterm capital gains rates.
        </p>
<p class="mt-4">
<b>Mining Stocks and Funds:</b>
          Some investors see opportunity in owning shares of companies that mine for gold and silver, or mutual funds that hold portfolios of these miners.
